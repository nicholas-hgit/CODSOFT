<p>This repository consists of 5 tasks that I completed as part of my internship at codsoft</p>

<h2>Task 1</h2>
<h3>Number Game</h3>
<p>The number game is a program where the system generates an integer within a specified range</p>
<p>It then prompts the player to guess the number, and then provides feedback on whether the number is too high, too low, or correct</p>
<p>There is a constraint on the number of times a user is allowed to guess the number i.e 6 times</p>
<p>The player is allowed to play multiple rounds</p>
<p>At the end it displays the score, which is based on the number of times the player correctly guessed the number</p>
