<h1>CODSOFT</h1>
<p>This repository consists of 5 tasks that I completed as part of my internship at codsoft</p>

<h2>Task 1</h2>
<h3>NUMBER GAME</h3>
<p>The number game is a program where the system generates an integer within a specified range</p>
<p>It then prompts the player to guess the number, and then provides feedback on whether the number is too high, too low, or correct</p>
<p>There is a constraint on the number of times a user is allowed to guess the number i.e 6 times</p>
<p>The player is allowed to play multiple rounds</p>
<p>At the end it displays the score, which is based on the number of times the player correctly guessed the number</p>

<h2>Task 2</h2>
<h3>STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR</h3>
<p>This program collects the marks obtained out of 100 in each of the student's subject</p>
<p>Then calculates the average percentage and the grade of the student based on the obtained marks</p>
<p>The output is the student's total mark, average percentage and corresponding grade</p>

<h2>Task 3</h2>
<h3>ATM INTERFACE</h3>
<p>This program is a basic ATM interface</p>
<p>It includes options such as withdrawing money, depositing and checking available balance</p>
<p>And some validations to ensure that the user's input is within acceptable limits</p>
<p>Appropriate messages are displayed to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions</p>

<h2>Task 4</h2>
<h3>QUIZ APPLICATION WITH TIMER</h3>
<p>This is a basic quiz application that enables users to take quizzes</p>
<p>The quistions includes multiple choice questions, in which case the user must provide the correct answer out of many possible answers</p>
<p>The quiz is timed. The user is only given 15 seconds to answer a question,in which failure to do so leaves the answer to that question blank, and then move to the next question</p>
<p>At the end, the user's score is displayed, along with the summary of the provided answers and correct answers</p>

<h2>Task 5</h2>
<h3>STUDENT COURSE REGISTRATION SYSTEM</h3>
<p>In this basic student course registration system</p>
<p>Students are allowed to register a profile on the student self-service platform</p>
<p>In which case they are provided with a student number</p>
<p>This student number is then used to verify the student and log them into the plaform</p>
<p>They can then decide to enroll in the available courses, view their registered courses, and also drop courses</p>
